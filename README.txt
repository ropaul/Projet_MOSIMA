Files names *.nlogo at the root of this folder contains multi-agents simulations which reproduce the work described in "Lew.pdf".
More specifically:
  --- "model_de_base.nlogo" enable the user to manipulate the initial model
  --- "beveridge_2.nlogo" runs multiples simulations and compute beveridge curves
  --- "sensibilityParametre" propose to modify up to 3 parameters and observe the change
  ---
  ---
  
These "*.nolo" files only exploit the below files and propose specific graphic interface.

In the folder "code" there are thematic code grouped together:
  --- "go.nls" containing all the dynamic procedures of the simulations
  --- "setup.nls" containing all the variable declarations and default values
  --- "display.nls" where all the graph and regressin are created
